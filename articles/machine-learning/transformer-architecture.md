# Introduction to Transformer Architecture

*Published: July 15, 2023*

## Overview

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the landmark 2017 paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al., revolutionized natural language processing and beyond. This architecture dispenses with recurrence and convolutions entirely, instead relying solely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output.

## Key Components

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The core innovation of the Transformer architecture is the multi-headed self-attention mechanism. Unlike RNNs or CNNs, self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when producing an output representation.

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    """Calculate the attention weights."""
    matmul_qk = tf.matmul(query, key, transpose_b=True)
    
    # Scale matmul_qk
    depth = tf.cast(tf.shape(key)[-1], tf.float32)
    logits = matmul_qk / tf.math.sqrt(depth)
    
    # Add the mask to the scaled tensor (if provided)
    if mask is not None:
        logits += (mask * -1e9)
        
    # softmax is normalized on the last axis (seq_len_k)
    attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(logits, axis=-1)
    
    output = tf.matmul(attention_weights, value)
    
    return output, attention_weights
```

### Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

Each layer in the Transformer contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically:

```python
def point_wise_feed_forward_network(d_model, dff):
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(dff, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)
    ])
```

### Positional Encoding

Since the Transformer doesn't use recurrence or convolution, it has no inherent sense of token order. Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of tokens in the sequence:

```python
def positional_encoding(position, d_model):
    angle_rads = get_angles(
        np.arange(position)[:, np.newaxis],
        np.arange(d_model)[np.newaxis, :],
        d_model
    )
    
    # apply sin to even indices in the array; 2i
    angle_rads[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle_rads[:, 0::2])
    
    # apply cos to odd indices in the array; 2i+1
    angle_rads[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle_rads[:, 1::2])
    
    pos_encoding = angle_rads[np.newaxis, ...]
    
    return tf.cast(pos_encoding, dtype=tf.float32)
```

## Applications

Transformers have found widespread use in:

1. **Machine Translation**: Models like Google's T5 and Facebook's BART
2. **Text Generation**: OpenAI's GPT series
3. **Document Summarization**: PEGASUS and BART
4. **Question Answering**: BERT and its variants
5. **Image Generation**: Vision Transformer (ViT)

## Performance and Efficiency

Transformers offer several advantages over previous architectures:

- **Parallelizability**: Unlike RNNs, which process sequences step by step, Transformers can process entire sequences in parallel
- **Long-range dependencies**: The attention mechanism allows Transformers to capture dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence
- **Scalability**: Transformer models have shown impressive scaling properties, with performance continuing to improve as models grow larger

## Conclusion

The Transformer architecture has become the foundation for most state-of-the-art NLP models and is increasingly being applied to other domains like computer vision and audio processing. Its flexibility, parallelizability, and ability to capture long-range dependencies make it a powerful tool in the modern deep learning toolkit.
